  - ### Wireframes

    The wireframes for QuizTmas were produced in [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

  - ### Site Structure

    The QuizTmas game was structured in HTML in 3 different pages: [**Play**], [**Rules**] and [**Contact**]. All the styling was developed in CSS and the logic in vanilla JavaScript. Its a combinations of a memory game template but instead of pictures when a card is clicked you trigger a question quiz, which makes more exciting when playing bacause you can get to pick easy questions or really difficult ones. The effects and transitions combined with modal popup engine makes the whole experience more pleasant and a feeling of well built.

  ### Future Features

    We want to implement 2 different surprise cards. So everytime the user picks a card he can either pick a Santa Claus picture, a Grinch picture or a question.
    If the user picks a Santa Claus it will give him a 2 points Bonus. If the user picks a Grinch card it will lose 3 points, and if the user picks a question he has a chance either to win one point by picking the right answer or lose a point.

- The website is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- The [**Code Institute**](https://codeinstitute.net/) modules/lessons aided my learning and many of the concepts learned were applied in this project.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) was used for the project repository.
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for all fonts on the site.
- [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the social media icons which then had additional styling applied to them.
- [**Colors CO**](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a colour pallete for this readme file.

## Deployment

First of all you need to have a [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) account, I choose [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) because it's free and easy to create a repository to host your code and share with others.

- To create a repository you just need to go to the main page at the top right you will see a "+" button just click here and then new repository

- Select the name of the project and a description make it public and then create a repository

- Once you created your repository go the settings section and then click on pages

- Select the Branch as main and then save it.

- Finally, your repository is deployed and it should show you a link so you can share it with others.
