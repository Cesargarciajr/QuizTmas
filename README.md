  - ### Wireframes

    The wireframes for QuizTmas were produced in [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies slightly from the wireframes due to developments that occured during the creation process.

## Technologies Used
I used the following technologies, platforms and support in building my project:
- Wireframes and mockups were designed in [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/#)
- The website is built with HTML and CSS only.
- The [**Code Institute**](https://codeinstitute.net/) modules/lessons aided my learning and many of the concepts learned were applied in this project.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) was used for the project repository.
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for all fonts on the site.
- [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for the social media icons which then had additional styling applied to them.
- [**Colors CO**](https://coolors.co/) was used to create a colour pallete for this readme file.
- [**Adobe Colors**](https://color.adobe.com/pt/create/color-contrast-analyzer) and contrast was used to pick color and check if the contrast was good enough for users.
- Also had to learn how to use Flexbox which plays a important role in positioning the sections and elements in the website which I learned from [**W3 Schools**](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp)

## Deployment

First of all you need to have a [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) account, I choose [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Cesargarciajr/bloom-of-life) because it's free and easy to create a repository to host your code and share with others.

- To create a repository you just need to go to the main page at the top right you will see a "+" button just click here and then new repository

- Select the name of the project and a description make it public and then create a repository

- Once you created your repository go the settings section and then click on pages

- Select the Branch as main and then save it.

- Finally, your repository is deployed and it should show you a link so you can share it with others.
